OSTEOARTHRITIS (OA) is one of the leading causes of disability and functional limitations in older adults. It is a multi-joint degenerative disease process which hinders the patient's movement. It is unfortunately accepted today as a common byproduct of ageing and the care provided is quite lacking. I was made aware of this when my mom had to undergo knee surgery and the rigorous rehab physiotherapy that followed. The short supply of trained physiotherapists coupled with the lack of feedback on the recovery inspired me to come up a solution which could help the users track the progress of their recovery post surgery. 
OrthoSense is a connected knee brace sleeve which uses e-textile based sensors to measure the joint gait characteristics along with acoustic data. OrthoSense would also be helpful for even orthopedic doctors to get a deeper insight into their patients outside of their clinical settings. A smartphone based physiotherapy would feasible with this platform.

## Getting Started
Our solution is a sensor enabled knee sleeve made with comfortable and non obstrusive fabric sensor for gait measurement(joint angle) along with other essential parameters of the knee joint for both the physiotherapist and the patient to monitor progression of the their joint ailment. Our solution is a low cost (85$) method for the patient to acquire better care for OA.  The solution can either be purchased by the patient or be prescribed by the doctor in a rental model to out patients.

## Future Concept 
I aim to move towards a smaller mems contact/directional microphone for picking up the knee sounds. The device will contour to the knee in a comfortable manner and the electronics will be easily removable. I aim to move to a new BLE chipset which allow transmission of the audio from the joint to the phone/tablet. A detailed app would be created soon which would have physiotherapy assisting animations and visualization tools.
